# The Swift Watch

Hi, fellow human!
I'm glad you found your way to this newsletter. Last year I sent a few newsletters out, but couldn't maintain a consistent schedule. As I started in my first iOS position in December, I want to force myself to keep learning and reading about Swift and iOS development every week. Curating this newsletter is a good way for me to do that. What can you expect?:
- Interesting articles
- Cool podcast episodes
- Everything else I see that might be interesting

It's fair to assume that the newsletter will be evolving as I work on finding the identity for it. So let's start!

## Podcasts
- One of the greatest news this year brought, was the come back of [Fireside Swift](https://www.firesideswift.com). 
This podcast has been my favorite Swift podcast since I found it late 2019. Last year they took a well deserved hiatus, 
but now they are back! Take a listen to their catchup episode to hear what you can except from the new season for Fireside Swift. 
They also have the best segways in the game!
- [Empowered Apps](https://www.empowerapps.show/77) had the co-creator of Swift Package Index, Sven A. Schmidt as a guest 
as the talked about the challenges of supporting the community by having a way to share their Swift packages. 
(Fun fact, I recently [released my first Swift package](https://swiftpackageindex.com/NiftyTreeStudios/Nifty-Dice-Roller), 
I'll be making it into a library and using it in a bigger project later.)
- In the latest episode of [Swift by Sundell](https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/swift-by-sundell/id1267161825?l=en&i=1000506906323), 
John Sundell talks with Matt Gallager about app architecture in Swift projects. 
Matt also wrote a couple of articles on the topic in his blog, Cocoa With Love. 
Find [part 1 here](https://cocoawithlove.com/blog/coding-through-iteration-and-integration.html), 
and [part 2 here](https://cocoawithlove.com/blog/swiftui-natural-pattern.html).

## Articles
- Decoupling is good practice, and this article on 
[Decoupling SwiftUI Views by Mohammad Azam](https://medium.com/swlh/decoupling-swiftui-views-for-reusability-fed0caaa458f)
is a good introduction how to practice decoupling in SwiftUI.
- This month I've been working on monochromacity at work, so 
[this article by Stephen Brown](https://medium.com/trinity-mirror-digital/adjusting-uicolor-luminosity-in-swift-4168e3c4cdf1) 
on adjusting luminocity with HSL values ended up being part of my solution.
- If you are working at making images monochromatic, read 
[this post by Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/media/how-to-desaturate-an-image-to-make-it-black-and-whitehttps://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/media/how-to-desaturate-an-image-to-make-it-black-and-white) 
on how to use CIFilter to do just that.
